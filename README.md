# Snake and Bats

Snake and Bats is a twist on the classic snake game built using Phaser 3. In this game, players control a snake that must collect apples while avoiding bats. Bats spawn randomly from the top of the screen with varying speeds and spawn points, adding an extra challenge to the gameplay. When the player collects a star power-up, some bats disappear temporarily, providing a strategic advantage.
